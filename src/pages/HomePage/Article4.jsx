              A tumor forms when cells grow and divide uncontrollably, creating an abnormal mass of tissue. According to the National Cancer Institute, tumors develop when cells multiply excessively or fail to die as they should. They can range in size from small nodules to large masses and may appear in various parts of the body.

                Benign tumors are non-cancerous, meaning they do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Once removed, they typically do not return. Most benign tumors do not cause harm or spread to other areas. However, they can create discomfort or complications if they press against nerves, blood vessels, or organs. Some may also lead to hormone overproduction, especially in endocrine-related cases.

                    Benign tumors arise from genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Family history, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infections, and chronic inflammation can trigger abnormal growth. Poor diet, obesity, and stress may also contribute. While non-cancerous, large tumors can press on organs or nerves, causing discomfort.

It is commonly caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and, while not cancerous, may develop into cervical cancer over 10â€“30 years. Treatment options include freezing techniques or removing a cone of tissue from the cervix.

                Malignant tumors are cancerous growths caused by uncontrolled cell division. They can spread to other parts of the body through metastasis, though some grow more slowly than others. When cancer cells spread, they retain the characteristics of the original tumor. For example, if lung cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver remain lung cancer cells. If left untreated, malignant tumors can become life-threatening.

                    The exact causes of tumor growth are often unclear, but several factors can increase the risk. Malignant tumors are linked to smoking, alcohol use, family history of cancer, tumor type, exposure to carcinogens, genetics, HPV, obesity, and being overweight, though risk levels vary by individual and cancer type. Benign tumors may develop due to frequent exposure to toxins and radiation, stress, diet, family history of tumors, and recurrent infections.

                    Malignant tumors often require imaging tests or screenings for detection. A biopsy confirms the diagnosis, with samples taken via needle or surgery if the tumor is suspected to be cancerous. Early detection is crucial, as malignant tumors can spread and become harder to treat. Regular health checkups help ensure timely diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.
